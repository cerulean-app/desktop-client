# desktop-client

A cross-platform desktop client for Cerulean.

## Development

For working on the desktop client, use the available npm scripts: `yarn build` to build the app into a `desktop-client` binary (`desktop-client.exe`, `webview.dll` and `WebView2Loader.dll` on Windows), `yarn start` to start the app from scratch and `yarn lint:js` to lint the JavaScript code.
